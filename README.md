Discovering possibilities to enhance editorial work
INTRODUCTION
Hi! I'm an old dude - who happens to work as an editor at a business magazine/site, trying to learn new tricks.
I'm a music lover (play myself too), have some kids (and even grandchildren) and try to stay up to date. 
That's it for now (I'm also a busy man ;-)
